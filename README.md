# MP-Jobs
This script is a jobs script for the MP-Framework. 

## How to get a job
Getting a job is simple. Go to the blip on the map, and start the job. This is only for non-whitelisted jobs. Whitelisted jobs require the player to apply just like every other server.

## Current Jobs
* Miner
* Taxi

  ## Future Jobs
* Police (Started but not finished)
* EMS
* Mechanic
* Possibly Drug dealer but this would be less of an assigned job and more a roleplaying job

## Dependencies
* MP Framework
* Ox Inventory
* Ox Lib
